## To Use With Real Verification

1. Get your client ID from https://app.parallelmarkets.com
2. Open `index.html`
3. Find line 338: `client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'`
4. Replace with your actual client ID
5. Change `environment: 'demo'` to `environment: 'production'`

Done! Users can now complete real verification.

## Why This Works

The Parallel Markets SDK does ALL the heavy lifting:
- âœ… KYC flows
- âœ… Accreditation checks
- âœ… KYB for businesses
- âœ… Document verification
- âœ… AML screening

You just:
1. Add the SDK script âœ“
2. Show the button âœ“
3. Handle the login event âœ“

That's the entire integration!
